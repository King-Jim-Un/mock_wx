============

As of this writing, we're still really early in the project's timeline. It seems to work, but what we need most is for
users to try writing tests with it on their own wxPython code. There are *so many* classes and members in wxPython, and
some of them have quirks that may need special coding to handle them.

When you find something you can't test, reduce the problem down to the simplest example you can and open a ticket. You
don't have to offer a solution, but unless I know about a problem, I can't hope to fix it.
